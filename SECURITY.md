To report a vulnerability, you can use private reporting. Check the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for this. You can also specify if you want to be named with the fix and security advisory statement that will be published alongside. 

Thank you for your contribution.
